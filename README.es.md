## How to get started?

1. Log on to (quickdatabasediagrams.com/)[https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/] and create a new diagram.
2. Make sure all your teammates are also logged in and invite them via email (Only one team member should do this step).
3. Then you can start creating your model and later share it.

## 📝Instructions

Create a data model based on the user stories you have defined for your project. This can also help you to evaluate the scope you have defined for it, if you notice that you need too many tables and that making transactions for each one of them will take you more time than available, you can adjust the functionalities you will include in your final project.

Once you have finished the model be sure to share the link for review.
